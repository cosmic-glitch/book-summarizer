<ul>
  <li><b>Overview of the Meeting:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A secret plan discussed by American military officials in December 1960 at the Strategic Air Command Headquarters.</li>
      <li>The plan involved a full-scale nuclear attack against the Soviet Union resulting in the death of 600 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at that time.</li>
      <li>Key officials present included high-ranking military personnel and Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering John H. Rubel.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Revelation by John H. Rubel:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>John H. Rubel, a firsthand witness of the meeting, revealed details of the plan in a memoir before his death in 2008.</li>
      <li>Rubel expressed remorse for his involvement in the plan, referring to it as "mass extermination."</li>
      <li>The plan involved multiple waves of nuclear attacks, with Moscow being a primary target for massive destruction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Shocking Details:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The plan called for a total of forty megatons on Moscow, significantly more destructive than the atomic bombs dropped during WWII.</li>
      <li>Rubel's revelation marked the first known instance of a meeting attendee sharing personal accounts of the plan, highlighting the genocidal nature of the proposed nuclear war strategy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The Girl in the Rubble, Nuclear War</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Survival and Aftermath:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Thirteen-year-old Setsuko Thurlow survived the atomic bomb detonation in Hiroshima in 1945.</li>
      <li>Found herself trapped under rubble, with a stranger helping her crawl to safety.</li>
      <li>Witnessed the devastation and horrific injuries suffered by others in the aftermath.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Immediate Effects and Response:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Dr. Michihiko Hachiya, director of Hiroshima Communications Hospital, also injured and shocked by the bomb.</li>
      <li>Found himself injured, disoriented, and searching for his wife amidst the chaos.</li>
      <li>Realized the severity of the situation and the massive destruction caused by the bomb.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Secrecy and Future Consequences:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Survivors' stories were suppressed by the U.S. Army to keep information classified after the bombings.</li>
      <li>Plans for future nuclear wars involving multiple atomic weapons were being considered after WWII's end.</li>
      <li>The potential devastation of a nuclear war was estimated to be catastrophic, with hundreds of millions of casualties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The Buildup, Nuclear War</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia National Laboratories:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>After World War II, Los Alamos lab faced uncertain future until the U.S. Navy sponsored atomic bomb tests, injecting new life into the atomic bomb program.</li>
      <li>A report warned of the destructive power of atomic bombs but recommended stockpiling more weapons due to the threat of a surprise attack from Russia.</li>
      <li>The race for nuclear supremacy intensified with the development of the hydrogen bomb, a thermonuclear weapon capable of immense destruction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Super:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>In 1952, the thermonuclear bomb, or hydrogen bomb, was invented with unprecedented destructive power.</li>
      <li>The first thermonuclear bomb test, Ivy Mike, obliterated an island and marked the beginning of a rapid increase in nuclear stockpiling by the U.S. and the Soviet Union.</li>
      <li>The development of thermonuclear weapons led to industrialized production, with thousands of weapons being produced yearly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Deterrence:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Nuclear war policies were shaped by the concept of deterrence, maintaining massive nuclear arsenals to discourage nuclear attacks.</li>
      <li>War planners focused on building and defending against nuclear attacks under the guise of deterrence, leading to exorbitant spending on nuclear weapons.</li>
      <li>The effectiveness of deterrence in preventing nuclear war was questioned, as the risk of failure raised concerns about the consequences of mass nuclear stockpiling.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The SIOP</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Establishment of the SIOP:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Less than two weeks after WWII, the U.S. military requested 466 nuclear bombs for the stockpile.</li>
      <li>Before 1960, each U.S. military force had its own nuclear war plans, leading to chaos.</li>
      <li>The secretary of defense ordered the integration of all plans into the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Details of the SIOP:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Strategic Air Command had 280,000 employees working on the new plan.</li>
      <li>The SIOP detailed a preemptive nuclear strike on Moscow, with estimated casualties of 600 million people, including millions in neighboring countries.</li>
      <li>General David M. Shoup was the only dissenter against the plan, criticizing the indiscriminate killing of millions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Comparison to Historical Events:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>John Rubel likened the SIOP meeting to the Nazi's Wannsee Conference planning the genocide of millions.</li>
      <li>Both events involved rational individuals deciding on mass extermination strategies.</li>
    </ul>
