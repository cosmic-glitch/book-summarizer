<ul>
  <li><b>The Gotrocks Family:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A wealthy family owning 100% of every stock in the U.S.</li>
      <li>Each year, they reaped all the earnings growth and dividends from the corporations.</li>
      <li>All family members grew wealthier at the same pace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>The Arrival of Helpers:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Helpers (brokers) convinced some "smart" cousins to buy and sell stocks among themselves.</li>
      <li>The Helpers received commissions, slowing the family's wealth growth.</li>
      <li>Stock trading also generated capital gains taxes, further diminishing wealth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Hiring Money Managers:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The cousins hired stock-picking experts (money managers) to gain an advantage.</li>
      <li>The managers charged fees, further reducing the family's share of the pie.</li>
      <li>Excessive trading by managers increased brokerage commissions and taxes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Hiring Consultants:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Failing to pick good managers, the cousins hired consultants to advise on manager selection.</li>
      <li>The consultants charged fees, further diminishing the family's returns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>The Wise Uncle's Advice:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A wise uncle advised getting rid of all the Helpers to reclaim 100% of the pie.</li>
      <li>This is what index funds do - hold all stocks passively with minimal costs.</li>
      <li>Successful investing is about owning businesses and reaping rewards through dividends and earnings growth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Rational Exuberance</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Shareholders Gains Must Match Business Gains</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Over the long run, returns earned by shareholders must match returns earned by the underlying businesses they own.</li>
      <li>Investment returns come from dividends and earnings growth, while speculative returns come from changes in price/earnings (P/E) ratios driven by investor emotions.</li>
      <li>Since 1900, investment returns (earnings growth + dividend yield) averaged 9% annually, while speculative returns added only 0.5% to total market returns of 9.5%.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Dual Nature of Stock Returns</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Stock returns have two components: investment returns (enterprise) and speculative returns (market sentiment).</li>
      <li>Investment returns from dividends and earnings growth are relatively steady, while speculative returns from changing P/E ratios are volatile.</li>
      <li>Periods of high/low speculative returns tend to revert to the mean over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Reversion to the Mean</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Stock prices often deviate from fundamental values, but eventually revert back to being priced based on business realities.</li>
      <li>Decades of high speculative returns are followed by decades of low speculative returns, and vice versa.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Real Market vs Expectations Market</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The "real market" is the business world of products, services, profits and dividends.</li>
      <li>The "expectations market" is where stock prices are set by speculation on future expectations, often disconnected from business realities.</li>
      <li>Investors should focus on the "real market" of businesses, not the distracting speculation of the stock market.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Cast Your Lot with Business</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Occam's Razor:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>When there are multiple solutions to a problem, choose the simplest one.</li>
      <li>The simplest way to own all U.S. businesses is to hold the total stock market portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500):</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Represents 500 largest U.S. corporations, weighted by market capitalization.</li>
      <li>Has been the accepted stock market portfolio for the past 90 years.</li>
      <li>Serves as a benchmark for evaluating performance of professional fund managers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Dow Jones Wilshire Total Stock Market Index:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Includes around 3,599 stocks, including the S&P 500 stocks.</li>
      <li>Best measure of the aggregate value and returns of U.S. stocks.</li>
      <li>Returns of S&P 500 and Total Stock Market Index are nearly identical over long periods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Index Funds Outperform Active Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>SPIVA report shows 90% of actively managed funds underperformed relevant indexes over 15 years.</li>
      <li>Vanguard 500 Index Fund (started in 1976) had an outstanding long-term performance.</li>
      <li>Owning a diversified, low-cost index fund is the simplest and most productive solution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>How Most Investors Turn a Winner's Game into a Loser's Game</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Arithmetic of Investing</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors as a group must necessarily earn the market return before costs are deducted.</li>
      <li>After accounting for the costs of investing (management fees, trading costs, etc.), the returns of investors fall short of the market return by the aggregate amount of those costs.</li>
      <li>Before costs, beating the market is a zero-sum game. After costs, it becomes a loser's game.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Impact of Costs</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The costs of investing for individual investors (trading costs) can average 1.5% or more per year.</li>
      <li>For actively managed mutual funds, expense ratios average around 1.3%, plus additional costs like sales charges and portfolio turnover costs.</li>
      <li>These costs compound over time, leading to a significant gap between investor returns and market returns over long periods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Relentless Rules of Arithmetic</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The chapter references Louis D. Brandeis, who warned about the "relentless rules of humble arithmetic" in investing.</li>
      <li>Most investors struggle to recognize the obvious reality of how costs erode returns over time.</li>
      <li>Financial intermediaries have little incentive to highlight this reality, as it goes against their self-interest.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Tyranny of Compounding Costs</b>
    <ul>
      <li>An example shows how a 2% annual cost gap leads to a dramatic difference in returns over 50 years ($294,600 vs. $114,700 on a $10,000 investment).</li>
      <li>Over long periods, the miracle of compounding returns is overwhelmed by the tyranny of compounding costs.</li>
      <li>Investors who put up all the capital and take all the risk end up with a small fraction of the potential market return.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Focus on the Lowest-Cost Funds</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Past Performance is Not a Reliable Indicator:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Most investors rely heavily on a fund's past performance when selecting funds.</li>
      <li>However, past performance is not predictive of future performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Costs Are the Key Factor Shaping Returns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A fund's costs are a powerful and often ignored factor that shapes its returns.</li>
      <li>The main costs are the expense ratio, sales loads, and portfolio turnover costs.</li>
      <li>These costs tend to persist over time for each fund.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Lower Costs Lead to Higher Returns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Studies consistently show that lower-cost funds outperform higher-cost funds.</li>
      <li>The difference in costs largely explains the performance gap between low and high-cost funds.</li>
      <li>Over 25 years, the lowest-cost quartile funds averaged 9.4% annual returns, while the highest-cost quartile averaged just 8.3%.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Focus on Minimizing Total Costs:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of chasing past performance, investors should focus on selecting the lowest-cost funds.</li>
      <li>Minimizing the total costs (expense ratios, loads, and turnover) is key to achieving higher net returns.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Dividends Are the Investor's (Best?) Friend</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Dividends' Significant Contribution:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Since 1926, dividends have contributed an average annual return of 4.2%, accounting for 42% of the stock market's 10% annual return.</li>
      <li>Reinvesting dividends leads to significantly higher returns - a $10,000 investment in 1926 would have grown to $59.1 million with dividends reinvested, compared to $1.7 million from price appreciation alone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Stability of Dividends:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>S&P 500 dividends per share have remained remarkably stable over 90 years, with only a few significant drops during crises like the Great Depression and 2008 financial crisis.</li>
      <li>Dividends per share reached a new high of $45.70 in 2016, 60% above the previous peak in 2008.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Mutual Funds Confiscate Dividends:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Actively managed mutual funds, whose fees are based on net assets rather than dividend income, consume a large portion of the dividends earned.</li>
      <li>In 2016, actively managed growth funds consumed 100% of dividend income through expenses, while value funds consumed 58%.</li>
      <li>In contrast, low-cost index funds consumed only 2-4% of dividend income through expenses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Case for Index Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Index funds have low expense ratios (as low as 0.04%) and deliver a fair share of dividend income to investors.</li>
      <li>They avoid the confiscation of dividends by active managers and the excessive trading costs associated with active management.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The Grand Illusion</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mutual Fund Returns vs. Investor Returns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Over the past 25 years, the average mutual fund earned a return of 7.8% per year, lower than the 9.1% return of the S&P 500.</li>
      <li>However, the average fund investor earned only 6.3% per year, 1.5 percentage points lower than the fund return itself.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>The Dual Penalties:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors incur a cost penalty from mutual fund expenses.</li>
      <li>They also incur a behavioral penalty due to counterproductive market timing and adverse fund selection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Counterproductive Investor Behavior:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors invested too little in equity funds when stocks were undervalued in the 1980s and early 1990s.</li>
      <li>They poured excessive amounts into equity funds, especially riskier ones, near the market peak in the late 1990s.</li>
      <li>Many investors sold near the market bottom during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, missing out on the subsequent recovery.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Fund Industry Promotions:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The fund industry compounds the problem by heavily marketing new, often riskier funds and advertising past returns of hot funds.</li>
      <li>This plays on investors' emotions and leads to counterproductive behavior.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Case for Index Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Index funds eliminate the temptation of chasing hot funds and remove emotions from the equation.</li>
      <li>The winning formula is owning the entire stock market through an index fund and staying the course for the long term.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Taxes Are Costs, Too</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tax Inefficiency of Active Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Active funds have high portfolio turnover (avg. 78% per year), leading to frequent realization of capital gains.</li>
      <li>This results in higher tax burdens for investors in active funds compared to index funds.</li>
      <li>High turnover is driven by active funds' short-term speculation rather than long-term investing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Impact of Taxes on Returns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>After accounting for taxes, the average actively managed equity fund had an annual after-tax return of 6.6% over the past 25 years.</li>
      <li>The index fund had an annual after-tax return of 8.6% over the same period.</li>
      <li>A $10,000 investment in active funds grew to $39,700 after taxes, compared to $68,300 for index funds - a $28,600 difference.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Index Fund Tax Efficiency:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Index funds have very low portfolio turnover (around 3% per year), minimizing realized capital gains.</li>
      <li>While index funds are tax-efficient on capital gains, they distribute more dividend income which is taxable.</li>
      <li>However, the overall tax burden is still lower for index fund investors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Expert Views:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The chapter cites experts like John Shoven, William Bernstein, and Burton Malkiel highlighting the tax advantages of index funds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>When the Good Times No Longer Roll</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Lower Future Returns Expected for Stocks and Bonds</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Historical stock returns were driven by earnings growth and speculative P/E expansion.</li>
      <li>Future stock returns likely around 4% (6% investment return - 2% speculative return).</li>
      <li>Bond returns closely tied to initial yield, currently around 3.1% for a diversified bond portfolio.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Balanced Portfolio Outlook</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A 60/40 stock/bond portfolio expected to return 3.6% before costs and inflation.</li>
      <li>After typical 1.5% costs for active management and 2% inflation, real return near 0.1%.</li>
      <li>Low-cost index funds could provide a 1.5% real return in this environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Implications of Lower Returns</b>
    <ul>
      <li>High costs severely erode already low expected returns for active funds.</li>
      <li>Avoiding financial devastation requires low-cost index funds or rock-bottom-cost active funds.</li>
      <li>Picking winning funds based on past performance is unlikely to succeed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Expert Projections Align</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Many economists and analysts also forecast subdued investment returns ahead.</li>
      <li>Projected returns range from slightly positive to negative for stocks and bonds.</li>
      <li>High fees are deemed illogical and unsustainable in this environment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Selecting Long-Term Winners</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Don't Look for the Needle—Buy the Haystack:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>It is extremely difficult to select winning mutual funds in advance based on past performance.</li>
      <li>Out of 355 equity funds that existed in 1970, only 10 (2.8%) outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 1% annually over the next 46 years.</li>
      <li>281 funds (79.2%) went out of business, mostly due to poor performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Fund Survival and Manager Turnover:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Only 74 out of the original 355 funds survived the 46-year period.</li>
      <li>Average tenure of active equity fund portfolio managers is only around 9 years.</li>
      <li>Successful funds often attract large inflows, making it harder to outperform in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Magellan and Contrafund Stories:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Fidelity Magellan and Contrafund were two of the few long-term outperformers, but their advantages diminished as assets grew.</li>
      <li>Magellan's outperformance declined as assets reached over $100 billion.</li>
      <li>Contrafund's recent outperformance has waned as assets crossed $100 billion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Case for Indexing:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Trying to select outperforming funds is like "looking for a needle in a haystack."</li>
      <li>A low-cost index fund would have matched or exceeded the returns of 97.2% of funds over the 46-year period.</li>
      <li>Investing in one index fund for a lifetime is simpler, more cost-efficient, and avoids the challenges of manager turnover and fund closures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Expert Advice on Indexing:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Warren Buffett recommends a low-cost S&P 500 index fund for his wife's trust.</li>
      <li>Paul Samuelson advises against the futile search for superior fund managers.</li>
      <li>Financial columnists echo the difficulty of picking winners and recommend index funds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Reversion to the Mean</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Short-Term Fund Performance is Poor Predictor of Future Success:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Over 150% of investor cash flows went into funds rated 4-5 stars by Morningstar in 2016, based heavily on short-term performance.</li>
      <li>But only 14% of 5-star funds in 2004 retained that rating a decade later, with 50% dropping to 3 stars or fewer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Lack of Persistence in Fund Returns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Among top quintile funds from 2006-2011, only 13% remained top quintile in 2011-2016, while 27% fell to bottom quintile.</li>
      <li>But 17% of bottom quintile funds from 2006-2011 became top quintile in 2011-2016.</li>
      <li>Similar lack of persistence seen in 2001-2006 and 2006-2011 periods.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Reversion to the Mean is Powerful:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Fund returns tend to revert to the average or below after periods of exceptional performance.</li>
      <li>Relative returns appear largely random, with steady reversion centering around 16% in each quintile.</li>
      <li>Up to 18% of funds failed to survive the subsequent 5-year period, likely due to poor performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Investor Bias and Chasing Performance:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors tend to chase recent winners, biased towards causal explanations over statistics.</li>
      <li>Past performance is not predictive of future results - "the math" shows this clearly.</li>
      <li>Chasing past winners is called one of the "stupidest things an investor can do" by experts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Seeking Advice to Select Funds?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Evidence on Selecting Winning Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Selecting winning equity funds for the long-term is extremely difficult, like finding a needle in a haystack.</li>
      <li>Selecting funds based on short-term past performance often leads to disappointment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Relying on Professional Advice:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Many investors seek advice from financial consultants (stockbrokers), registered investment advisers (RIAs), or insurance agents.</li>
      <li>RIAs can provide valuable services like asset allocation guidance, tax considerations, and general financial advice.</li>
      <li>However, there is no evidence that advisers as a group can consistently select funds that outperform the market.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Evidence on Advisers' Performance:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A study found that funds recommended by advisers underperformed those purchased directly, costing investors $9 billion per year.</li>
      <li>Merrill Lynch's "Focus Twenty" and "Internet Strategies" funds were marketing successes but investment disasters, with clients losing up to 86% of assets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Value of Advisers:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Advisers can provide peace of mind, help match risk tolerance, navigate complexities, and keep clients disciplined.</li>
      <li>However, advisers' fees can significantly reduce returns over time, so their value must be weighed against the cost.</li>
      <li>Advisers who recommend low-cost index funds in model portfolios are favored.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Fiduciary Standard:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>There is a trend towards establishing a federal fiduciary duty for advisers, requiring them to put clients' interests first.</li>
      <li>RIAs already have a fiduciary duty, but the standard would be extended to stockbrokers and insurance agents.</li>
      <li>The principle of fiduciary duty is expected to prevail, even if current proposals face challenges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Profit from the Majesty of Simplicity and Parsimony</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Hold Traditional Low-Cost Index Funds That Track the Stock Market:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Lessons from previous chapters:
        <ul>
          <li>Costs matter</li>
          <li>Selecting funds based on past performance doesn't work</li>
          <li>Fund returns revert to the mean</li>
          <li>Relying on advice works only sporadically</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Traditional index funds (TIFs) that own the entire stock market have the lowest costs (expense ratios as low as 0.04%)</li>
      <li>Monte Carlo simulation shows that over longer periods (50 years), only 2% of active managers would be expected to outperform passive index funds</li>
      <li>Index funds deserve an important place in your portfolio due to their simplicity and low costs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>All Index Funds Are Not Created Equal:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Costs vary widely among index funds tracking the same index</li>
      <li>Gap of 1.3% in expense ratios between low-cost and high-cost S&P 500 index funds</li>
      <li>High-cost funds also charge front-end sales loads</li>
      <li>Example: Vanguard 500 Index (0.04% expense ratio) grew $10,000 to $294,900 over 33 years, while higher-cost Wells Fargo fund grew to only $232,100</li>
      <li>Select the lowest-cost index funds from reputable fund organizations</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Indexing Works in All Market Segments:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Conventional wisdom says indexing works for efficient markets like S&P 500, but active management may have an edge in less efficient markets</li>
      <li>Data shows indexing works well in all market segments, whether efficient or inefficient</li>
      <li>International and emerging market indexes outperformed majority of active funds</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Caution About Gambling on Sector Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Betting on winning market sectors is gambling, not investing</li>
      <li>Emotions negatively impact returns investors achieve in sector funds</li>
      <li>Most popular sector funds are those with recent spectacular performance, leading to poor timing</li>
      <li>Owning a traditional low-cost stock index fund is the ultimate strategy with mathematical certainty</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Bond Funds</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Relentless Rules of Arithmetic Apply:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The rules of humble arithmetic apply even more forcefully to bond funds than stock funds.</li>
      <li>A single factor - prevailing interest rates - dominates bond returns.</li>
      <li>Bond fund managers cannot influence interest rates set by the market.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Why Hold Bonds?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Stocks have historically provided higher long-term returns than bonds.</li>
      <li>But bonds can outperform stocks in shorter periods and reduce portfolio volatility.</li>
      <li>Current bond yields (3.1%) exceed stock dividend yields (2%), providing income advantage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Bond Fund Manager Performance:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>As a group, bond fund managers track the bond market, delivering gross returns in line with interest rates.</li>
      <li>After expenses and fees, bond fund returns lag appropriate bond indexes.</li>
      <li>85% of actively managed bond funds underperformed indexes over 15 years (2001-2016).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Types of Bond Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term: Lower yield, reduced volatility risk.</li>
      <li>Long-term: Higher yield, increased volatility risk.</li>
      <li>Intermediate-term: Balance between yield and volatility.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Index Bond Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Total bond market index funds track high-quality bond indexes (e.g. Barclays Aggregate).</li>
      <li>Provide broad diversification, low costs, tax efficiency similar to stock index funds.</li>
      <li>Outperform majority of active bond funds due to lower costs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>ETF as a "Wolf in Sheep's Clothing":</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed to facilitate trading, contrary to the buy-and-hold principles of traditional index funds (TIFs).</li>
      <li>Offers less diversification by focusing on sectors or factors, increasing risk compared to broad market exposure.</li>
      <li>Higher costs from trading commissions and taxes erode returns, contradicting the low-cost paradigm of TIFs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Creation of the "Spider":</b>
    <ul>
      <li>First U.S. ETF, tracking the S&P 500 Index, launched in 1993.</li>
      <li>Offered potential competition to traditional S&P 500 Index funds, but with trading flexibility.</li>
      <li>Remains the largest ETF with over $240 billion in assets, but high trading volume and turnover.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>ETF Growth and Diversity:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>ETFs now account for 50% of all index fund assets, with over 2,000 ETFs available.</li>
      <li>Offerings span broad market, sector, smart beta, leveraged, and other specialized strategies.</li>
      <li>Investor cash flows into ETFs are highly volatile compared to TIFs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Challenges with ETFs:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors in concentrated ETFs often chase past returns, leading to underperformance.</li>
      <li>Costs from trading commissions and taxes compound over time, eroding returns.</li>
      <li>Encourages short-term speculation and market timing rather than long-term investing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Warnings and Concerns:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>ETFs benefit entrepreneurs, brokers, and fund managers more than investors.</li>
      <li>Potential for harm increases as offerings become more specialized and complex.</li>
      <li>Straying from broad diversification and low costs contradicts the principles of indexing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Index Funds That Promise to Beat the Market</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Traditional Index Funds</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditional index funds tracking broad market indexes like the S&P 500 have been highly successful, providing better returns than actively managed funds.</li>
      <li>Assets in traditional index funds have grown massively as investors recognize their benefits.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>New "Smart Beta" Index Funds</b>
    <ul>
      <li>New index funds claim to beat the market by tracking indexes weighted by factors like value, momentum, dividends, etc. instead of market cap.</li>
      <li>These "smart beta" funds are marketed as a new paradigm and revolution in indexing that can provide higher returns.</li>
      <li>However, their long-term ability to outperform is unproven and defies market efficiency principles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Skepticism Towards Smart Beta</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The author expresses strong skepticism towards claims that smart beta strategies can consistently beat the market.</li>
      <li>Data shows smart beta funds have performed similarly to cap-weighted indexes over 10 years.</li>
      <li>Quotes from finance experts like Mankiw, Sharpe, and Siegel warn against buying into new indexing paradigms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Sticking to Traditional Indexing</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The author advocates sticking to traditional cap-weighted index funds that capture full market returns.</li>
      <li>Chasing new strategies promising market-beating returns is unlikely to work out well in the long run.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>What Would Benjamin Graham Have Thought about Indexing?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Graham's Advice for Defensive Investors:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Most investors should be "defensive" and settle for the market's return rather than trying to beat it.</li>
      <li>Advocated owning a diversified portfolio and holding for the long-term to earn dividends and growth.</li>
      <li>Cautioned against expecting too much from advisors and Wall Street.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Index Funds Align with Graham's Philosophy:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Graham described an investment approach very similar to index funds before they existed.</li>
      <li>He acknowledged picking winning stocks was increasingly difficult over time.</li>
      <li>In 1976, he stated the average manager cannot outperform the market indexes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Graham Would Have Endorsed Index Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Graham saw no reason why investors should accept inferior returns from active management.</li>
      <li>He believed superior returns were harder than they looked, while capturing market returns was easier.</li>
      <li>Warren Buffett stated Graham endorsed low-cost index funds for most investors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Asset Allocation I: Stocks and Bonds</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Significance of Asset Allocation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>An academic study found asset allocation accounts for 94% of differences in portfolio returns.</li>
      <li>More important than fund selection, asset allocation between stocks and bonds is a crucial decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Benjamin Graham's 50/50 Stock/Bond Allocation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommended 25-75% stocks, 75-25% bonds, with 50/50 as the standard division.</li>
      <li>Allowed conservative investors to benefit from stock gains while limiting downside risk.</li>
      <li>Based on stock yield premiums over bonds in his era (6.9% vs 1.9%).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Factors Influencing Asset Allocation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Ability to take risk (financial position, future liabilities, time horizon).</li>
      <li>Willingness to take risk (personal risk tolerance).</li>
      <li>Younger investors can be more aggressive (e.g., 80% stocks), older investors more conservative (e.g., 25% stocks).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Key Asset Allocation Decisions:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Strategically allocating between stocks and bonds based on individual circumstances.</li>
      <li>Maintaining a fixed ratio or allowing it to vary with market returns.</li>
      <li>Whether to employ tactical changes in allocation based on market conditions.</li>
      <li>Using actively managed funds or low-cost index funds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Cost Impact on Asset Allocation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Lower-cost portfolios may earn higher net returns than higher-risk, high-cost portfolios.</li>
      <li>Cost is a critical factor to consider when deciding stock/bond allocations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Asset Allocation II</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Balanced Index Fund Success:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The 60/40 balanced index fund (60% stocks, 40% bonds) has been an extraordinary success.</li>
      <li>Over 25 years, it earned 8.0% annually versus 6.3% for its peers, a 1.7% yearly advantage.</li>
      <li>Its low 0.14% expense ratio and high correlation with peers suggest continued outperformance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Retirement Income Strategy:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>During retirement, focus on steady income rather than portfolio value fluctuations.</li>
      <li>Combine Social Security payments with dividends from index funds for growing retirement income.</li>
      <li>Consider using fund capital withdrawals in addition to dividends to meet income needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Non-U.S. Stocks in Portfolios:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The traditional two-fund model (U.S. stocks and bonds) has given way to a three-fund model with non-U.S. stocks.</li>
      <li>Though U.S. stocks outperformed over the past 25 years, more global diversification may be warranted going forward.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Target-Date and LifeStrategy Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>These funds offer diversified portfolios with stocks/bonds adjusted for investor goals and timeframes.</li>
      <li>Target-date funds automatically become more conservative as the target retirement date nears.</li>
      <li>Consider low-cost index target-date funds over higher-cost actively managed versions.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Social Security in Asset Allocation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Social Security acts as a bond-like asset and should be accounted for in asset allocation.</li>
      <li>Deferring Social Security increases eventual monthly payments but means foregoing income for years.</li>
      <li>Properly accounting for Social Security may call for a higher stock allocation than expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Investment Advice That Meets the Test of Time</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Recommends owning equity holdings in an S&P 500 index fund or a total stock market index fund.</li>
      <li>Suggests holding bonds in a total bond market index fund.</li>
      <li>Highlights Warren Buffett's endorsement of index funds as the best way to own common stocks for most investors.</li>
