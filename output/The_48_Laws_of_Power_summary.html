  </li>
  <li><b>Reversal:</b>
    <ul>

  </li>
</ul><h2>Law 14: Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy</h2>

  </li>

    </ul>

</ul><h2>Law 15: Crush Your Enemy Totally</h2>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Reversal:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases, allowing enemies to self-destruct can be more advantageous than directly crushing them.</li>
