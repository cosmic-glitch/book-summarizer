<h2>Key Ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>The Power of Index Investing</b>
<ul>
<li>Over the long run, individual investors are better off owning low-cost index funds that track the entire stock market rather than trying to pick winning stocks or actively managed mutual funds.</li>
<li>Index funds have significantly lower costs, are more tax-efficient, and deliver higher returns than the vast majority of actively managed funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>The Relentless Rules of Humble Arithmetic</b>
<ul>
<li>The high costs of investing, including expense ratios, transaction costs, sales loads, and taxes, dramatically reduce the returns earned by the average investor.</li>
<li>Minimizing these costs is the most reliable way to maximize long-term investment returns. Index funds keep costs to a bare minimum.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>The Importance of Asset Allocation</b>
<ul>
<li>An investor's allocation between stocks and bonds is a crucial decision that has a major impact on long-term returns and risk.</li>
<li>A simple balanced index fund with 60% stocks and 40% bonds is an excellent choice for most investors, providing strong returns and reasonable stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Staying the Course</b>
<ul>
<li>Once an investor has selected a prudent asset allocation and low-cost index funds, the most important thing is to stay the course and maintain a long-term perspective.</li>
<li>Avoid chasing past performance, attempting to time the market, or letting emotions drive investment decisions. The winning strategy is to buy and hold for the long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Focus on the Wisdom of Great Investors</b>
<ul>
<li>Many of the greatest investors in history, from Benjamin Graham to Warren Buffett, have advised that index funds are the best way for most people to invest in stocks.</li> 
<li>Their commonsense principles - minimize costs, diversify widely, invest for the long-term - are accessible to everyone through index funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>By keeping costs low and harnessing the long-term growth of business and the stock market, investors can secure their financial futures and, in the words of Benjamin Franklin, find "the way to wealth."</p>
