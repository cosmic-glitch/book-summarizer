<h2>The Cognitive Revolution</h2>
<p>Around 70,000 years ago, Homo sapiens underwent a "Cognitive Revolution" that enabled unprecedented abilities like abstract thought and communication through complex language. This allowed humans to create shared myths and imagined realities, enabling large-scale cooperation and cultural development. The unique human ability to create fiction has shaped our society ever since.</p>

<h2>The Agricultural Revolution</h2>
<p>Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agriculture. While often seen as a great leap forward, the Agricultural Revolution required more labor for a less nutritious diet. It led to population growth, but also social stratification, disease, and a harder life for the individual. Agriculture was history's biggest fraud - a luxury trap that humans fell into.</p>

<h2>The Unification of Humankind</h2>
<p>The trend of human history has been towards global unity. Empires, money, and universal religions have spread common cultures and values. The imperial cycle has unified peoples through conquest, acculturation and assimilation. Capitalism emerged as a new universal faith, promising growth through reinvestment of profits. Global European empires were built on the power of guns, germs, capitalism and industrialization.</p>

<h2>The Scientific Revolution</h2>
<p>Modern science, beginning around 500 years ago, is characterized by a willingness to admit ignorance, reliance on observation and mathematics, and the acquisition of new powers. The scientific method allowed for rapid technological development, which in turn drove imperial expansion and global unification. Science and empire have had a symbiotic relationship.</p>

<h2>The Industrial Revolution</h2> 
<p>The Industrial Revolution saw an explosion of productivity and energy use through new technology and materials. The factory model transformed concepts of time, work, and urban life. Nuclear families and local communities broke down as imagined communities of nations and consumers took their place. The pace of change became the only constant.</p>

<h2>Happiness and the Future</h2>
<p>Despite immense progress, it is unclear if humans today are happier than in the past. Happiness seems to depend more on subjective expectations than on objective conditions. The biological and genetic engineering revolutions may allow us to design our minds and bodies. The future of sapiens is both marvelous and terrifying to contemplate.</p>
