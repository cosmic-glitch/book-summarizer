<img src='https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91L0La1pwDL._SL1500_.jpg' style='width:100px;height:auto;'>

<h2>Investment vs Speculation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Investment promises safety of principal and adequate return, while speculation does not</li>
<li>Defensive investors should have a 25-75% allocation between stocks and bonds, rebalancing when needed</li>
<li>Aggressive investors should look for undervalued securities and special situations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impacts of Inflation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Inflation erodes bond returns but stocks provide some protection against rising prices</li>
<li>Conservative investors need a balance of both stocks and bonds to minimize risks from unexpected inflation or deflation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Market Fluctuations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most investors cannot successfully time the market, so a formulaic 50/50 stocks/bonds approach is prudent</li>
<li>True investors are owners of companies, not just stock traders, and should not be overly swayed by short-term fluctuations</li>
<li>Buy when prices are irrationally low and sell when irrationally high, as demonstrated by the "Mr. Market" analogy</li>
</ul>

<h2>Defensive Stock Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look for companies with:
  <ul>
    <li>Large size</li>
    <li>Strong finances</li>
    <li>Earnings and dividend stability</li>
    <li>Moderate valuations and growth rates</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>A quantitative, criteria-based approach can yield a diversified portfolio of high-quality, reasonably priced stocks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Margin of Safety</h2>
<ul>
<li>Defined as the gap between price and estimated intrinsic value, which allows room for error and misfortune</li>
<li>Is the central concept that distinguishes investment from speculation</li>
<li>Is harder to find in the current high-priced market, especially for growth stocks</li>
<li>Undervalued, "bargain" securities can have a large margin of safety despite being viewed as speculative</li>
</ul>
