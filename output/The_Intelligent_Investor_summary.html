<h2>Investment versus Speculation: Results to Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Defining Investment vs Speculation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investment operation promises safety of principal and adequate return</li>
      <li>Speculation does not meet these requirements</li>
      <li>Criticism of calling all stock market participants "investors"</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Results for the Defensive Investor:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Recommends 25-75% allocation between bonds and stocks</li>
      <li>In 1965, could get 4.5% yield on bonds, 3.2% on stocks</li>
      <li>Now (1972) bonds yield 7.5%, stocks around 3.5%</li>
      <li>Bonds appear preferable, but stocks hedge against inflation</li>
      <li>Suggests 50/50 bonds/stocks with 5.5% expected after-tax return</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Results for the Aggressive Investor:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Trading, short-term selectivity unlikely to yield better results</li>
      <li>Long-term growth stocks prone to over-valuation</li> 
      <li>Look for unloved, undervalued stocks and special situations</li>
      <li>These areas less fruitful recently due to increased competition</li>
      <li>Still opportunities if can add 5%+ to returns vs market averages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>The Investor and Inflation</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Inflation's Impact on Fixed-Income Investments:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Inflation erodes purchasing power of fixed dollar income from bonds.</li>
      <li>This has led some to argue for 100% stock portfolios over bonds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Historical Analysis of Inflation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The U.S. has experienced significant inflation periods in the past.</li>
      <li>Reasonable to expect future 3% annual inflation based on recent trends.</li>
      <li>This would reduce real returns on bonds by about half but not necessarily erode principal.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Stock Performance in Inflationary Periods:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>No clear connection between inflation and stock earnings/prices in short-term.</li>
      <li>Earnings on corporate equity capital have declined over past 20 years despite inflation.</li>
      <li>Inflation has not increased real profitability due to rising costs and capital needs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Other Inflation Hedges:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Gold has underperformed inflation over the long run.</li>
      <li>Real estate can hedge inflation but has risks and limited diversification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Recommended Portfolio Strategy:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Conservative investors should hold both bonds and stocks.</li>
      <li>Stocks provide some inflation protection but have higher risk than bonds.</li>
      <li>Balance is needed to minimize risks from unexpected inflation or deflation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>A Century of Stock-Market History: The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Stock Market Fluctuations Over 100 Years:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Table 3-1 shows major bull and bear market swings from 1871 to 1971 using the Cowles-Standard 500 Composite Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</li>
    <li>Chart depicts fluctuations in Standard & Poor's 425-industrial stock index from 1900-1970, showing distinct patterns over three periods.</li>
    <li>From 1900-1924, relatively similar market cycles of 3-5 years with 3% annual advance.</li>
    <li>1924-1949 saw the 1929 peak and subsequent collapse, followed by irregular movements.</li>
    <li>1949-1968 saw the greatest bull market in history, with the DJIA rising over 6-fold by 1966 at an 11% annual rate plus dividends.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Earnings, Dividends, and Price/Earnings Ratios:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Table 3-2 shows decadal averages of stock prices, earnings, dividends, and related ratios from 1871-1970.</li>
    <li>Growth was persistent but variable, with post-WWII performance superior to earlier decades.</li>  
    <li>Price/earnings ratios rose dramatically after WWII, from 6.3 in 1949 to 22.9 in 1961 as investor attitudes changed.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
  
<li><b>Evaluating the 1972 Market Level:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Table 3-3 compares ratios like price/earnings, dividend yields vs bond yields for the S&P 500 at various past years.</li>
    <li>While the 1972 3-year P/E ratio was not extremely high, the earnings/price vs bond yield ratio was the least favorable of the years examined.</li>
    <li>The author views the early 1972 level near the DJIA 900 mark as unattractive for conservative investment, similar to his 1964 view.</li>
    <li>Another substantial rise is possible before the next setback, but the market's "heedlessness" after the 1969-70 collapse is concerning.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Recommended Policy:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow the conservative policy recommended in 1964: no borrowing, no increasing stock holdings, reduce holdings to 50% maximum if needed.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul><h2>General Portfolio Policy: The Defensive Investor</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Bond-Stock Allocation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Defensive investors should divide funds between high-grade bonds and high-grade common stocks.</li>
      <li>Suggested range: 25% to 75% in common stocks, with the rest in bonds.</li>
      <li>The standard division should be 50-50 between bonds and stocks.</li>
      <li>Increase stock allocation when prices are low, reduce when prices are high.</li>
      <li>A 50-50 formula is proposed: rebalance when stock allocation moves above 55% or below 45%.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>The Bond Component:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose between taxable or tax-free bonds based on investor's tax bracket.</li>
      <li>U.S. Savings Bonds (Series E and H) offer unique advantages like tax deferral and redemption flexibility.</li>
      <li>Other bond choices include U.S. Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds.</li>
      <li>Higher yields are available from lower-grade bonds, but defensive investors should avoid them.</li>
      <li>Bank savings deposits and CDs can substitute for short-term bond investments.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Preferred Stocks:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Preferred stocks have weaknesses in their legal position compared to bonds and common stocks.</li>
      <li>Only a small percentage maintain strong investment status through adversity.</li>
      <li>Preferred stocks should be bought at bargain prices by defensive investors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Security Forms:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Income bonds, where interest is paid only if earned, have advantages but are underutilized.</li>
      <li>Convertible issues and other specialized forms are discussed separately.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>The Defensive Investor and Common Stocks</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Investment Merits of Common Stocks:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Common stocks offer protection against inflation and tend to have higher average returns than bonds due to dividend income and underlying growth.</li>
      <li>However, these benefits can be lost if the investor pays too high a price for the stocks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Rules for the Common-Stock Component:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Adequate but not excessive diversification (10-30 different stocks).</li>
      <li>Each company should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed.</li>
      <li>Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments (at least since 1950).</li>
      <li>Limit the price paid to 25 times the average earnings over the past 7 years, and 20 times the earnings of the latest 12 months.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Growth Stocks and the Defensive Investor:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Growth stocks are too risky and speculative for defensive investors due to their high prices relative to earnings.</li>
      <li>Examples of volatility in growth stocks like IBM and Texas Instruments are provided.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Portfolio Changes:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Defensive investors should have their portfolios reviewed periodically by reputable advisors.</li>
      <li>Advisors should adhere to the rules for common-stock selection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Dollar-Cost Averaging:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investing the same dollar amount regularly in stocks can lead to good returns over time.</li>
      <li>It prevents investing at wrong times and can be done systematically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>The Investor's Personal Situation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Specific examples of a widow, doctor, and young man are discussed.</li>
      <li>The defensive strategy is recommended unless the investor has expertise and temperament to be an "enterprising" investor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: Negative Approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Start from the Same Base as the Defensive Investor:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Divide funds between high-grade bonds and reasonably priced high-grade common stocks.</li>
      <li>Branch out into other investments only with well-reasoned justification.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Negative Approach for Enterprising Investors:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid high-grade preferred stocks, as they are better suited for corporations.</li>
      <li>Avoid inferior bonds and preferred stocks unless bought at bargain prices (at least 30% below par for high-coupons).</li>
      <li>Avoid foreign government bonds, as they lack legal enforceability.</li>
      <li>Be wary of new issues, especially convertible bonds/preferreds and common stocks with only recent earnings history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Second-Grade Bonds and Preferred Stocks:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Not advisable to buy for marginally higher yields when high-grade bonds offer over 7% yield.</li>
      <li>Susceptible to severe price declines during market downturns, even if earnings are not bad.</li>
      <li>Some eventually recover when conditions improve, but unpredictable which ones.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>New Common Stock Offerings:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Tend to be of lower quality companies as bull markets progress.</li>
      <li>Often sold at exorbitant prices driven by public frenzy.</li>
      <li>Usually followed by severe price collapses of 75% or more.</li>
      <li>Intelligent investors should resist blandishments of salesmen offering new issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising Investor: The Positive Side</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>General Market Timing:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Graham advises against trying to time the market based solely on formulas, as market fluctuations require special trading skills.</li>
  <li>He suggests the 50-50 plan outlined for defensive investors as the best automatic formula.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Growth Stock Approach:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Growth stocks tend to be overpriced, and most investors cannot obtain better results from them than professional funds.</li>
  <li>Graham recommends avoiding growth stocks selling at high P/E ratios (over 20 times average earnings).</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Three Recommended Approaches:</b>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Buying Relatively Unpopular Large Companies:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Look for large, prominent companies selling below their average price/earnings ratios - the "Dogs of the Dow" approach.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Purchase of Bargain Issues:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Buy stocks selling at less than 2/3 of their appraised value, or less than net current assets.</li>
    <li>Also consider bargain bonds and secondary companies selling at depressed prices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Special Situations or "Workouts":</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Complex corporate events like mergers, reorganizations, etc. can create bargain opportunities if misunderstood by the market.</li>
    <li>But this requires highly specialized knowledge and is not for most investors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li><b>Implications of the Rules:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>Most investors should be defensive and avoid riskier securities at full prices.</li>
  <li>Enterprising investors must view investing as a business to undertake more complex strategies.</li>
  <li>Following Graham's advice could depress prices of secondary stocks, but this reflects reality.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Investor and Market Fluctuations</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Fixed Income Investments and Market Fluctuations:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term, high-grade bonds are not significantly affected by market price changes.</li>
      <li>Long-term bonds and common stocks are subject to wide price fluctuations over time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Anticipating Market Fluctuations:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Attempting to anticipate market movements by timing (forecasting future course) is generally futile for investors.</li>
      <li>Pricing (buying at fair values and selling above) is a more promising approach than timing.</li>
      <li>Buy-low-sell-high approach worked well historically but became difficult after the 1949-50 market rise.</li>
      <li>Formula investment plans that automatically sell on market rises can cause investors to miss out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Fluctuations and the Intelligent Investor:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>True investors should not be overly concerned with short-term market fluctuations.</li>
      <li>Market quotes provide convenience for increasing/decreasing holdings, but are not binding.</li>
      <li>Investors should view themselves as part-owners of businesses, not just stock traders.</li>
      <li>The more successful a company, the greater the potential for large stock price fluctuations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>The A&P Company Example:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A&P's stock price fell extremely low in 1938 despite its strong business, demonstrating market irrationality.</li>
      <li>The market can be wrong, allowing investors to profit from its mistakes.</li>
      <li>Businesses change over time, so investors should re-evaluate companies periodically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Mr. Market Analogy:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investors should form their own independent opinion and not blindly follow "Mr. Market's" daily pricing.</li>
      <li>Buy when prices are irrationally low and sell when irrationally high, but be patient otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Investing in Investment Funds</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mutual Fund Performance vs the Market:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutual funds as a group have performed roughly in line with broad market indexes over long periods.</li>
      <li>It is difficult for any mutual fund to consistently outperform the market averages by a wide margin.</li>
      <li>Top performing funds one year often fail to maintain that performance in subsequent years.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>"Performance" Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>The cult of "performance" fueled unrealistic expectations and excessive risk-taking by some funds.</li>
      <li>Many "performance" funds achieved spectacular short-term gains through speculation but later suffered major losses.</li>
      <li>The intelligent investor should avoid funds promising miracles and chasing past performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Closed-End vs Open-End Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Closed-end funds often sell at a discount to their net asset value, while open-end funds sell at a premium.</li>
      <li>The intelligent investor should buy closed-end funds at a discount of 10-15% rather than pay a premium for open-end funds.</li>
      <li>There is little evidence that premium-priced closed-end funds offer superior long-term performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Balanced Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Balanced funds hold a mix of bonds and stocks, but often have low income yields.</li>
      <li>Investors may be better off holding high-quality bonds directly rather than through a balanced fund.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The Investor and His Advisers</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Reliance on Investment Advice:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Investing in securities often involves seeking advice from others.</li>
      <li>Investors are amateurs, so they feel professional guidance can help them profit.</li>
      <li>But seeking advice on how to make money has an element of naivety.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Sources of Investment Advice:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Relatives or friends presumed knowledgeable about securities.</li>
      <li>Local (commercial) bankers.</li>
      <li>Brokerage firms or investment banking houses.</li>
      <li>Financial services or periodicals.</li>
      <li>Investment counselors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Investment Counsel and Trust Services:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Established investment counsel firms charge substantial fees.</li>
      <li>They typically invest in standard interest/dividend-paying securities.</li>
      <li>Aim to conserve principal and produce acceptable income.</li>
      <li>Trust services of large banks operate similarly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Financial Services:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide bulletins, market forecasts, and individual security advice.</li>
      <li>Can be useful for information, but forecasts have little significance.</li>
      <li>Security recommendations often lack thorough analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Advice from Brokerage Houses:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Customers' brokers earn commissions, so can be speculation-minded.</li>
      <li>Financial analysts study securities but may focus too much on near-term prospects.</li>
      <li>Analysts can be valuable if the investor is value-minded, not quotation-minded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Investment Bankers:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Underwrite and sell new securities issues.</li>
      <li>Dealings with public investors involve an adviser-salesman conflict.</li>
      <li>Investor should apply independent judgment, not blindly trust recommendations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Other Advisers:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Local bankers can provide conservative, steadying influence.</li>
      <li>Advice from relatives or friends is often unreliable.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Security Analysis for the Lay Investor: General Approach</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Bond Analysis:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Primary tests for safety of bonds and preferred stocks are coverage of interest charges by earnings over past years.</li>
      <li>Graham recommends specific "coverage" standards based on type of company for bonds to be considered investment grade.</li>
      <li>Other tests include size of enterprise, equity cushion, property values (for utilities and real estate companies).</li>
      <li>Past earnings coverage has proven a reliable guide for future bond safety and avoiding defaults.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Common Stock Analysis:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Ideal approach is to estimate average future earnings and apply an appropriate capitalization multiplier.</li>
      <li>Factors affecting the multiplier include prospects, management, financial strength, dividend record/rate.</li>
      <li>Formulas have been developed for valuing growth stocks based on expected growth rates, but have limitations.</li>
      <li>Industry analysis can provide insights but Wall Street forecasts are often inaccurate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Recommended Two-Part Appraisal:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>First determine "past performance value" based solely on historical factors like profitability, stability, growth.</li>
      <li>Then modify this value based on analysis of future factors expected to differ from the past.</li>
      <li>Provides a systematic approach and useful experience, though valuations may still have limitations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Things to Consider About Per-Share Earnings</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Multiple Earnings Figures:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Companies often report multiple earnings per share figures (primary, diluted, before/after special charges, etc.)</li>
      <li>Investors need to understand what each figure represents and use the appropriate one for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Special Charges:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Companies sometimes exclude costs as "special charges" to boost reported earnings.</li>
      <li>Special charges may relate to legitimate future losses, but are often used opportunistically.</li>
      <li>Investors should scrutinize special charges and consider them part of normal earnings.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Tax Benefits from Past Losses:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Past losses can reduce tax liabilities and inflate future earnings through tax credits.</li>
      <li>Investors should consider reported earnings with and without tax benefits from losses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Dilution from Convertibles:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Convertible securities like bonds or warrants can dilute earnings per share if converted.</li> 
      <li>Fully diluted earnings per share figures account for potential dilution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Accounting Methods:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Depreciation methods, inventory valuation, R&D treatment also impact reported earnings.</li>
      <li>Changes in accounting methods can cause earnings distortions year-to-year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Use of Average Earnings:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Using multi-year average earnings can smooth out cyclical fluctuations.</li>
      <li>Growth rate should be calculated to evaluate average earnings relevance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Two Approaches:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>DJIA-type portfolio: Buy a cross-section of leading blue-chip stocks, e.g. the 30 DJIA issues.</li>
  <li>Quantitatively-tested portfolio: Apply a set of criteria to each stock purchase.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Seven Criteria for Quantitative Selection:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>1. Adequate Size: At least $100 million in sales for industrials; $50 million in assets for utilities.</li>
  <li>2. Strong Financial Condition: Current ratio at least 2:1; long-term debt less than working capital for industrials. Debt less than 2x equity for utilities.</li>
  <li>3. Earnings Stability: Some earnings for common stock in each of the past 10 years.</li>
  <li>4. Dividend Record: Uninterrupted dividends for at least 20 years.</li>
  <li>5. Earnings Growth: At least 33% increase in EPS over the past 10 years using 3-year averages.</li>
  <li>6. Moderate P/E Ratio: Current price no more than 15 times 3-year average earnings.</li>
  <li>7. Moderate Price/Book Ratio: Current price no more than 1.5 times book value. (Price/Book) x (P/E) should not exceed 22.5.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li><b>Commentary:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>The criteria eliminate most companies as too small, weak finances, poor dividend record, or overpriced.</li>
  <li>The modest growth requirement avoids including stagnant companies.</li>
  <li>The P/E limit aims for an earnings yield as good as high-grade bond yields.</li>
  <li>The defensive investor must judge if the criteria are too strict versus analysts' more generous recommendations.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>

In essence, Graham advocates a quantitative approach to build a portfolio of large, conservatively financed companies with continuous earnings, dividends, and moderate growth - purchased at reasonable prices based on earnings and assets. This allows the defensive investor to safely participate in stock market returns while minimizing the risk of permanent loss.
<h2>Stock Selection for the Defensive Investor</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Seven Criteria for Selecting Defensive Stocks:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Adequate size of enterprise (e.g. $100 million revenue for industrials)</li>
      <li>2. Sufficiently strong financial condition (e.g. current ratio over 2, manageable debt)</li>
      <li>3. Earnings stability (some earnings for common stock over last 10 years)</li>
      <li>4. Dividend record (uninterrupted dividends for at least 20 years)</li>
      <li>5. Earnings growth (minimum 33% increase in per-share earnings over last 10 years)</li>
      <li>6. Moderate price/earnings ratio (P/E under 15 for industrial stocks)</li>
      <li>7. Moderate ratio of price to assets (P/B ratio under 1.5, with restrictions)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Applying Criteria to Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1970:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Only 5 of 30 DJIA stocks met all 7 criteria (American Can, AT&T, Anaconda, Swift, Woolworth)</li>
      <li>Around 100 listed industrial stocks may have qualified based on the criteria</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>The Public-Utility "Solution":</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Vast majority of utility stocks met the criteria for performance and price in 1972</li>
      <li>Offered good growth, earnings stability, higher dividend yields at lower P/E and P/B ratios</li>
      <li>Advantages of regulated monopolies in raising capital and offsetting inflated costs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
   
  <li><b>Investing in Financial Companies:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial condition more important due to high leverage and regulations</li>
      <li>Broad performance similar to industrials from 1948-1970</li>
      <li>Cautions about assessing soundness of financial companies</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Stock Selection for the Enterprising Investor</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Performance of Mutual Funds:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Mutual funds have generally failed to outperform broad market averages over long periods.</li>
      <li>Possible reasons: market efficiency, flaws in analytical approach focused on growth prospects rather than value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Graham-Newman Methods:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Arbitrages - Buying securities being exchanged in corporate reorganizations.</li>
      <li>Liquidations - Buying shares of companies being liquidated.</li>
      <li>Related hedges - Buying convertible issues and shorting the underlying common stock.</li>
      <li>Net-current-asset bargains - Buying stocks at less than net current asset value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Secondary Companies:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Use Standard & Poor's Stock Guide to screen for stocks meeting criteria like:
        <ul>
          <li>P/E ratio under 9</li>
          <li>Current assets > 1.5x current liabilities</li>
          <li>Debt < 110% of net current assets</li>
          <li>No deficits in last 5 years</li>
          <li>Dividend payments</li>
          <li>Recent earnings growth</li>
          <li>Price < 120% of net tangible assets</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Applying these criteria can yield a list of 100+ potential bargain stocks.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Single Criteria Tests:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Tested performance of portfolios based on single criteria like low P/E, high dividend, etc.</li>
      <li>Random stock portfolios underperformed market indexes.</li>
      <li>Higher quality rankings and very large companies performed relatively well.</li>
      <li>"Goodwill giants" with high intangible asset values also did well.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Net-Current-Asset Bargains:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Historically a successful approach when such bargains were available.</li>
      <li>But opportunities have been limited in recent decades.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Convertible Issues and Warrants</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Convertible Securities Overview:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Convertibles allow the issuer to raise capital at lower cost by offering a conversion privilege.</li>
      <li>But investors often give up quality or yield when buying convertibles.</li>
      <li>Convertibles issued late in bull markets tend to perform poorly when the market declines.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Issues With Owning Convertibles:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Deciding whether to sell after a small gain or hold for a bigger advance is difficult.</li>
      <li>Holdings tend to have fully as many substantial losses as gains.</li>
      <li>Convertibles perform poorly in declining markets compared to straight bonds.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Effect on Common Stock:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Convertible issues dilute current and future earnings per share of the common stock.</li>
      <li>Fast-growing "conglomerates" have been major practitioners of this dilution.</li>
      <li>In some cases, the convertible preferred is more attractive than the common stock.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Stock Warrants:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Warrants create huge market values "out of thin air" and serve no legitimate purpose.</li>
      <li>They dilute and reduce the true value of the common stock.</li>
      <li>Warrants fabricate imaginary market values and should be prohibited or limited.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>A Comparison of Eight Pairs of Companies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Pair 1: Real Estate Investment Trust vs. Realty Equities Corp.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Real Estate Investment Trust was a conservatively managed enterprise, keeping debt low and growth moderate.</li>
      <li>Realty Equities rapidly expanded assets and debt through diversification into various ventures, using complex financial instruments.</li>
      <li>Realty Equities' overexpansion led to large losses, auditor issues, and a plummeting stock price.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Pair 2: Air Products and Chemicals vs. Air Reduction Co.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Air Products had higher profitability and growth but traded at a premium valuation.</li>
      <li>Air Reduction had lower profitability but was undervalued compared to assets and earnings.</li>
      <li>Choosing between the "quality" premium stock or the "bargain" value stock was difficult to judge definitively.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Pair 3: American Home Products Co. vs. American Hospital Supply Co.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Both were large, successful "health industry" companies with stable earnings growth.</li>
      <li>Home Products had higher profitability and lower valuation multiples.</li> 
      <li>Hospital Supply had lower profitability but higher growth, leading to a much higher valuation multiple.</li>
      <li>Neither met Graham's criteria for a sound, reasonably priced investment at the time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Pair 4: H&R Block vs. Blue Bell</b>
    <ul>
      <li>H&R Block had a "meteoric" rise but extremely high valuation over 100x earnings.</li>
      <li>Blue Bell was a steadily growing company in a competitive industry but valued modestly.</li>
      <li>The market's optimism about Block appeared excessive compared to the undervalued Blue Bell.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Pair 5: International Flavors & Fragrances vs. International Harvester</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Flavors & Fragrances was a smaller but highly profitable "one-product" business.</li>
      <li>Harvester was a conglomerate with low profitability despite massive sales volume.</li>
      <li>Flavors & Fragrances' high valuation was justified by excellent profits, unlike Harvester's poor showing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Pair 6: McGraw Edison vs. McGraw-Hill</b>
    <ul>
      <li>McGraw-Hill had lower sales/earnings but higher valuation multiples due to investor enthusiasm.</li>
      <li>The excessive valuation of McGraw-Hill seemed unjustified given declining profitability.</li>
      <li>McGraw Edison appeared reasonably valued relative to its operating performance.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Pair 7: National General Corp. vs. National Presto Industries</b>
    <ul>  
      <li>National General was a large conglomerate with complex capital structure and high valuation.</li>
      <li>National Presto was a simple operating company with modest valuation despite strong profits.</li>
      <li>National General's high valuation seemed grossly inflated compared to its actual economics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><b>Pair 8: Whiting Corp. vs. Willcox & Gibbs</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Whiting was a conservatively-run industrial company with steady profits and high dividend.</li>  
      <li>Willcox & Gibbs was a struggling conglomerate with low profits and no dividend.</li>
      <li>Whiting seemed enormously undervalued relative to the overvalued Willcox & Gibbs.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Shareholders and Managements: Dividend Policy</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Historical Dividend Debate:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Traditionally, shareholders wanted more liberal cash dividends while managements preferred retaining earnings for growth.</li>
      <li>Managements argued shareholders should sacrifice present income for the company's long-term benefit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Changing Attitudes Toward Dividends:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Today, growth companies often pay low dividends and retain earnings for profitable reinvestment.</li>
      <li>Investors approve of low payout ratios for rapidly growing companies that can deploy capital effectively.</li>
      <li>For slower-growth companies, the case for paying out a normal portion of earnings (e.g. two-thirds) is stronger.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Guidelines on Dividend Policy:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Shareholders should demand a normal payout or clear evidence that retained profits increase per-share earnings.</li>
      <li>Low payouts due to weak financial condition are understandable, but expansion by struggling companies seldom benefits shareholders.</li>
      <li>Detailed explanations and defenses are needed if an underperforming company retains most earnings for growth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Stock Dividends vs Stock Splits:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A stock dividend represents capitalization of recent reinvested earnings into new shares.</li>
      <li>A stock split is just a change in share structure to reset prices, with no surplus transfer.</li>
      <li>Graham advocated periodic, clearly defined policies for stock dividends to avoid confusion.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

The key points emphasize evaluating whether a company's dividend policy serves shareholder interests, with a balanced view allowing reinvestment for growth when productive while advocating shareholder rights to reasonable payouts from underperforming companies.
<h2>"Margin of Safety" as the Central Concept of Investment</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>Definition of Margin of Safety:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>For bonds, it is the amount by which business assets or earnings exceed debt obligations, providing a cushion against potential losses.</li>
      <li>For stocks, it is the difference between the stock's price and the estimated intrinsic value, with the price being lower than the value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Importance of Margin of Safety:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>It allows room for imprecision, inevitable mistakes, and unfavorable circumstances in calculating value.</li>
      <li>It renders unnecessary an accurate estimate of the future for an investment to succeed.</li>
      <li>It is the central concept of investment, distinguishing it from speculation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Margin of Safety for Stocks:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Historically, the earnings yield on stocks was much higher than bond yields, providing a margin of safety.</li>
      <li>Currently, with high stock prices, the margin of safety has been eroded or eliminated for many stocks.</li>
      <li>Growth stocks tend to have inadequate margins of safety at market prices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Undervalued Securities and Margin of Safety:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Bargain securities trading well below their value have a large margin of safety.</li>
      <li>This makes them sound investments, despite being regarded as speculative by conventional standards.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Diversification and Margin of Safety:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Diversification increases the overall margin of safety by reducing the impact of mistakes.</li>
      <li>It is based on the principle that the aggregate gains will exceed the aggregate losses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><b>Defining Investment vs. Speculation:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A true investment requires a provable margin of safety, demonstrated by figures and sound reasoning.</li>
      <li>Speculation lacks a true margin of safety and rests largely on subjective judgments.</li>
    </ul>
