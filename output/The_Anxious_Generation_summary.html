    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>The Surge of Suffering</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Wave Begins:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>From the early 2010s, a surge in adolescent mental illness rates, particularly anxiety and depression, observed internationally.</li>
      <li>Sudden increase in major depressive episodes, especially notable for girls, nearly tripling in prevalence rate.</li>
      <li>Depression rates increased by roughly 150% for both sexes, impacting all races and social classes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Nature of the Surge:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase in internalizing disorders related to anxiety and depression.</li>
      <li>Sharp rise in anxiety rates, with depression following closely behind, especially among high school and college students.</li>
      <li>Depression linked to social disconnection and weakened interest in seeking social relationships.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>It’s Not Real, Is It?</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Financial crises, global warming, and world events not sole contributors to rising mental health issues among adolescents.</li>
      <li>Gen Z's mental health decline not solely attributable to external calamities or societal issues.</li>
      <li>Collective anxiety around global threats historically does not lead to rising mental illness rates, differs from individual impact.</li>

      <li>Global patterns show increased feelings of school loneliness and alienation, particularly evident after 2012.</li>
      <li>The rise in mental health issues not exclusive to Western nations, suggests a common digital influence worldwide.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>What Children Need to Do in Childhood</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Slow-Growth Childhood:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Human children experience rapid growth in the first two years, slow down for the next seven to ten years, followed by a growth spurt during puberty.</li>
      <li>Evolutionary reasons for extended childhood include the need to learn from cultural experiences and acquire knowledge from society.</li>
      <li>Children engage in experiences to form neuronal connections, solidify skills, and learn societal knowledge during extended childhood.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Free Play:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Play is essential for developing social and physical skills in children through low-stakes, repeated activities with feedback.</li>
      <li>Physical play with some risk is crucial for children to learn safety and cooperation.</li>
      <li>Unsupervised, child-led play helps children learn emotional regulation, social skills, and conflict resolution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Attunement:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Children are wired to connect by synchronizing movements and emotions with others from a young age.</li>
      <li>Smartphones can disrupt face-to-face interaction and lead to distractions during attunement, affecting social bonds.</li>
      <li>Synchronous interactions build trust and deepen relationships, crucial for social development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Social Learning:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Children copy behaviors from conformist bias to fit in and prestige bias to imitate the accomplished.</li>
      <li>Social media platforms shape behavior quickly through likes, comments, and shared posts, impacting adolescents' learning and social development.</li>
      <li>Mass media and social media influence adolescents' perception of prestige and excellence, altering social learning behaviors.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Expectant Brains and Sensitive Periods:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Humans have sensitive periods for learning, where specific experiences are easier to acquire during certain ages.</li>
      <li>Sensitive periods for cultural learning and language acquisition occur during childhood and adolescence, affecting identity development.</li>
      <li>Heavy social media use during puberty has shown negative correlations with life satisfaction and mental health in adolescents.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Discover Mode and the Need for Risky Play</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Antifragile Children:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Children must face frequent stressors to develop strength and resilience.</li>
      <li>Exposing children to setbacks and challenges helps wire their brains toward "discover mode."</li>
      <li>Overprotection inhibits development, leading to fragile and anxious adults.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Role of Risky Play:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Thrilling experiences in risky play have anti-phobic effects, helping children overcome fears.</li>
      <li>Kids instinctively seek out increasing levels of risk to master fears and develop competencies.</li>
      <li>Risky play fosters physical and psychological competences in children.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Shift to Defend Mode:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Modern parenting trends in Western nations emphasize supervision and fear, shifting children towards "defend mode."</li>
      <li>Parents' increased focus on safety limits children's opportunities for autonomy and growth.</li>
      <li>Children spending more time in defend mode are less likely to seek new experiences and more prone to anxiety.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Impact of Safetyism:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Safetyism deems safety as the utmost priority, hindering children from facing risks and learning self-reliance.</li>
      <li>Emotional safety has expanded to encompass avoiding negative emotions, leading to anxiety related to triggers.</li>
      <li>Safetyism limits children's exposure to conflicts and challenges necessary for growth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>The Attachment System:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Children require a "secure base" to explore and learn, balancing between safety and discovery.</li>
      <li>Healthy attachments foster autonomy and competence, shifting children towards discover mode.</li>
      <li>Fearful parenting may keep children overly reliant on adults, hindering their growth and development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul><h2>Puberty and the Blocked Transition to Adulthood</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Puberty, Plasticity, and Vulnerability:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Human brain development during puberty involves selective pruning of neurons, leaving only frequently used ones.</li>
      <li>Cultural experiences, rewarding activities shape brain structures, influencing identity and behavior.</li>
      <li>Myelination, the coating of neurons’ axons, speeds up, leading to increased brain efficiency.</li>
      <li>Puberty makes adolescents more vulnerable to stressors, impacting mental health and well-being.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Experience Blockers: Safetyism and Smartphones:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Restricting children from necessary risky experiences can hinder development and resilience.</li>
      <li>Overprotection and reliance on smartphones reduce valuable real-world experiences and challenges.</li>
      <li>Smartphones attract children, diminishing interest in non-screen experiences required for optimal brain development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Rites of Passage:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Adolescent rites of passage guide children into adulthood, emphasizing cultural learning and social standing.</li>
      <li>Rites mark transitions like separation, transition, and reincorporation, preparing individuals for new roles and responsibilities.</li>
      <li>Historically gendered, rites now reflect societal values and structures, focusing on different milestones for boys and girls.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Building a Ladder from Childhood to Adulthood:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Proposed norm-based milestones at even-year birthdays to facilitate a structured transition to adulthood.</li>
      <li>Focusing on increasing freedoms, responsibilities, and independence as children progress through stages of development.</li>
      <li>Advocating for shared milestones to guide children towards competent and flourishing adulthood within diverse secular societies.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Addiction:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Behaviorist techniques employed by app designers to hook adolescents to smartphones and social media.</li>
      <li>Smartphones trigger dopamine release, creating craving and compulsion for more digital engagement.</li>
      <li>Adolescents susceptible to addiction suffer from withdrawal symptoms, affecting mood, behavior, and overall well-being.</li>
