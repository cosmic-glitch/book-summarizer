<p>In Outlive, Peter Attia argues for a new approach to longevity focused on extending healthspan - the period of life free from disease and disability. Modern medicine excels at treating acute conditions but struggles against chronic "diseases of civilization" like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and dementia. To delay the onset of these diseases, we need proactive strategies for optimizing health decades before symptoms appear.</p>

<p>Lessons from centenarians, who avoid chronic disease until much later in life, suggest that resilience and healthspan are key. While genes play a role, evidence shows lifestyle interventions can mimic some longevity advantages. Attia proposes targeting aging mechanisms through five key domains:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Exercise</b> - Developing endurance, strength, and stability to maintain physical function. New concepts like the "Centenarian Decathlon" guide training for lifelong fitness.</li>
  <li><b>Nutrition</b> - Personalizing eating patterns based on individual metabolic responses and goals. Moving beyond fad diets to sustainable "nutritional biochemistry".</li>  
  <li><b>Sleep</b> - Prioritizing sleep to support brain health, emotional regulation, and metabolic fitness. Sleep is essential medicine, not a luxury.</li>
  <li><b>Emotional health</b> - Addressing trauma and building emotional resilience. Mental well-being is crucial for overall health and longevity.</li>
  <li><b>Drugs/molecules</b> - Judicious use of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and supplements with evidence for healthspan benefits.</li>
</ol>

<p>For each domain, the book details the underlying science and provides actionable tactics. Early interventions like aggressive cholesterol reduction, cancer screening, and Alzheimer's prevention are emphasized. Attia advocates an "evidence-informed" rather than strictly "evidence-based" approach to enable personalized strategies.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Outlive aims to empower individuals with the knowledge and tools to extend healthspan. By optimizing these five domains through consistent daily choices, we may substantially delay disease onset and maintain vitality well into old age - thereby "outliving" the norm. But it requires taking action now to alter our future health trajectories.</p>
